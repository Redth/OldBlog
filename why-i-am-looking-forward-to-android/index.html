<h2>The Back Story</h2>

<p>Way back in Froyo days, I took the leap from my iPhone 3G to Android as my daily device with a Samsung Galaxy S.  I was co-authoring a book <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026438/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118026438&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=red082-20">Professional Android Development with Mono and C#/.NET</a></strong></p>

<p>Android was new, it was exciting, it was <em>different</em>.  It was also slower, higher maintenance, and had me flashing roms weekly.  Not necessarily a problem for a supergeek like me, but still tiresome and prone to moments of <em>Oh sorry, that&#8217;s a bug in my phone&#8217;s rom</em> or <em>my battery&#8217;s dead because of all the services i have running</em>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it wasn&#8217;t very long before I was back on the iPhone train.  I was content with the iPhone 4, and then the iPhone 4S, and now the iPhone 5.  They&#8217;re all great devices, they just workâ€¦ as long as you want to use them how Apple intends.</p>

<p>The primary reasn I&#8217;m switching back to Android, is my Galaxy S just doesn&#8217;t cut it for development anymore.  My wonderful wife will inherit my iPhone 5 (like she does all my devices), and I&#8217;ll have a Nexus 4 to test on soon.</p>

<h2>Why I&#8217;m looking forward to Android</h2>

<p>I have a Nexus 7.  It&#8217;s quite nice.  I like it better than the iPad, with the exception of a lack of apps in some areas (games).  Android 4.2, I feel, finally starts to get things right.  Sure there&#8217;s still issues, but by and large it&#8217;s a good operating system.  The eco-system is also quite mature now.  Most, if not all the apps I use daily on iOS (which seems to be less nowadays) all exist in a reasonably good form on Android (save for maybe a really good Twitter client, but that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m currently working to fix!).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting excited for Android.  See, the iPhone was great, but there are a lot of <em>compromises</em> I&#8217;ve had to make to be a happy iOS user.  When I think about the things that bug me with iOS, Android largely has them right:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Gmail:</strong> Ok, Google <em>JUST</em> released a better Gmail app for iOS again.  They actually did this just after I ordered my Nexus 4.  It&#8217;s much better, however it&#8217;s still not as awesome as Gmail on Android.</li>
<li><strong>Default Apps:</strong> Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, all great apps and services.  But on iOS, I can&#8217;t choose to have links open in Chrome, I can&#8217;t choose Gmail as my default mail client, nor can I have Google Maps default for navigation.  I love that on Android I can finally do these things.</li>
<li><strong>LockScreen Patterns:</strong> I have a confession:  I&#8217;ve not got any passcode set on my iPhone.  I hate typing in passwords every time I want to unlock my screen.  One thing I loved on Android was the pattern unlock.  It felt much quicker, more intuitive, just easier.  I&#8217;m happy to get back some security with little pain!</li>
<li><strong>Lockscreen Widgets:</strong> This is a pet peave of mine on iOS.  At least notifications show up now, but I want to be able to see a bit more information so I can glance at the lockscreen and decide if I should open my phone or not.  This is welcomed in android!</li>
<li><strong>Notification Bar:</strong> Google invented the notification bar.  It&#8217;s way better than iOS&#8217;s.  I love how it shows a small icon in the status bar at the top of the screen, alluding to there being more notifications.  I also like how rich notifications can be in Android, and that I can swipe individual ones away, or clear the whole lot of them.  It&#8217;s just a much better implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Google Now:</strong> Siri is great, but Google Now seems more well thought out.  Since I already use gmail, I&#8217;m looking forward to getting <em>cards</em> with shipping status of things I&#8217;ve ordered, or <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/05/google-now-boarding-pass/" title="boarding passes">boarding passes</a>, automatically, without me telling it.  This is a great system that surely requires some tweaking yet, but the idea that Google can give me the information I want when I need it, without me asking for it is awesome!</li>
<li><strong>Google Maps:</strong> Just like Gmail, google <em>JUST</em> released a maps app for the iPhone.  It&#8217;s actually really, really good!  I am however, still looking forward to being able to cache some areas offline, and having Google Maps used as the <em>default</em> navigation app on my OS.</li>
<li><strong>No Lightning:</strong> I still have only one lightning cable, partially because they&#8217;re hard to find, and partially because I HATE spending $20 on a usb cable.  I do love that the cable is reversable, but it&#8217;s not compelling enough for me not to be excited about having an endless supply of charging cables again :)</li>
</ol>


<h2>What I&#8217;ll Miss</h2>

<p><img src="/images/Android-And-Back/iphone-sad.jpg" alt="Mou icon" /></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s be honest.  There&#8217;s some things iOS just does right.  I&#8217;ll no doubt miss several things about my iPhone, but I think we&#8217;re finally at the stage the things I miss on Android are greater than those I miss on iPhone:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Apps!</strong> Yeah, the Android ecosystem is WAY better than back in Froyo days, but iPhone still wins when it comes to games, and just sheer quantity of <em>quality</em> apps.  I&#8217;ll miss this, though not as much as I would have years ago.</li>
<li><strong>Fit &amp; Finish:</strong> iPhone is a very polished OS.  There&#8217;s no denying this.  Android has made strides to improve the <strong><em>butter</em></strong>yness of the interface, but iPhone is still king for that polished feeling.</li>
<li><strong>Siri:</strong> One thing I already know google now can&#8217;t do is create reminders for a future day.  I&#8217;m sure this will get added at some point, but it&#8217;s one thing I use a lot with Siri right now, and I&#8217;m going to miss it!</li>
<li><strong>Airplay:</strong> This is actually the big thing I&#8217;m going to miss.  I have two Apple TV&#8217;s, and while I don&#8217;t use it a lot, Airplay screen mirroring is incredibly useful when I do want it.  Android just doesn&#8217;t do this, and there&#8217;s no silver bullet in sight.  I guess I&#8217;ll have to pull out the iPad when I want to do this!  At least I can still control my iTunes remotely on Android and have it play to my AppleTV!</li>
</ol>


<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to say whether I&#8217;ll love Android, or find some of the same things annoying that caused me to switch back to iPhone.  I&#8217;m sure there will be some remorse at times, but I think overall, I&#8217;ll really enjoy being back on Android for all the right reasons.  Plus, now I can finally stop having people ask me why I use an iPhone once they find out I helped write <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026438/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118026438&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=red082-20" title="a book on Android programming">a book on Android programming</a>!  Stay tuned, I&#8217;ll be posting again after using my Nexus 4 for awhile to see how it&#8217;s going!</p>
