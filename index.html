  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just before the new year, <a href="/Blog/why-i-am-looking-forward-to-android">I wrote a post about switching back to Android</a> (to a Nexus 4), and I was excited at the prospect.  I explained that I’d been a long time iOS user (quite happily so), except for a brief stint on Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) which ended not so well.</p>

<p>Well, it’s been about a month now since I’ve switched back to Android, and I’m not looking back anytime soon!  I’m going to do a quick recap about the things I love, and the things I miss:</p>

<h2>What I Love</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Load All the Things!</strong> This is something I’m surprised people don’t complain more about, and one thing that has bothered me about iOS since day one.  It’s gotten better with faster devices and faster network connections, but I <em>REALLY</em> hate getting for instance, a Twitter notification, and then once I launch the app, having to wait for the item that triggered the notification to be loaded.  I really love it when Android apps go out and prefetch this data when a Push Notification comes in, so that when I decided to act on the notification and open the app, the data is already there.  The same goes for email.  If you don’t want to use the default mail app, every time you open the mail app (Gmail for instance), you must wait for the data to load, even though you probably already know who the email is from since it told you in the push notification.  I cannot stress enough <em>HOW MUCH TIME</em> this has given back to me on Android.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Maven</strong> I always thought the bigger phones were too big.  I drank the iPhone screen size Kool-Aid, but I loved the bigger iPhone 5.  I will say that 6” seems too big still, but my 4.7” Nexus 4 screen is just awesome.  It still fits easily in my pocket, and the added real estate is great for typing, and browsing.  Even the iPhone 5 feels too tiny now when I have it in my hands.</li>
<li><strong>The Google Experience</strong> I’m a big user of Google services, so it comes as no surprise that I love the Google apps on Android.  Google has recently improved its iOS offering dramatically, but at the end of the day it still works just a bit better on Android.</li>
<li><strong>Settings Quick Toggles</strong> In the pull down notification bar, there’s a button that flips to a view of tiles of several shortcuts to settings, such as Brightness, WiFi, Airplane mode, Bluetooth.  In 4.2.2, you can now quickly toggle some of these things on and off from this menu.  So, to toggle WiFi, I swipe down, tap the settings button, and tap and hold the WiFi.  Pretty quick and less annoying than iOS</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><img src="/Blog/images/Android-Love/Quick-Toggles.png" alt="Quick Toggle Settings" /></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apps without Borders</strong> One thing that always bugged me about iOS as an end user was how each app felt like the lonely island it was.  I love in Android how when I tap a link, or perform some action, I’ll get a little menu asking me which App I’d like to have handle this action.  iOS does this to an extent now, but Android is better at it, and Android effectively lets me choose a default App to deal with the content type.  I love not being forced into using the default Mail app or Browser, if I don’t want to!</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><img src="/Blog/images/Android-Love/Share-Content.png" alt="Sharing Content" /></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Google Now</strong> Siri is great, but Google Now is better in almost all respects.  I find the voice transcription way faster and more accurate, and Google Now’s ‘card’ design really works for me.  If you can get over the fact Google is in your email, you can learn to love having a card pop up with tracking info on the package you just ordered, or movie tickets you bought.  There’s so much depth to Google Now it could be its own post, but it’s safe to say I really like it.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><img src="/Blog/images/Android-Love/Google-Now-Cards.png" alt="Google Now Cards" /></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Notifications</strong> I’ve always liked Google’s notification bar way better than how iOS deals with it, so I’m not surprised to feel right at home with it.  I am pleasantly surprised, however, at how useful having an LED indicator for notifications is.  The LED basically allows me to decide if I need to even turn my screen on or not.  I also really like how apps are starting to take advantage of rich notifications in the pull down tray.  Music apps allow me to skip next, twitter notifications allow me to tap reply right from in the tray.  This is a really strong point for Android, and I find myself wasting much less time on Notifications than I did in iOS</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><img src="/Blog/images/Android-Love/Rich-Notification.png" alt="Rich Notifications" /></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>UI</strong> This is where many of you will disagree with me.  I actually have taken a strong liking to the Android UI, or at least the apps that do a good job of it.  If you haven’t played with Android recently, you may not realize that developers have started to take care with how they design their apps.  There’s still a lot of junk out there, but for nearly any App I use on a regular basis, there’s a very nicely designed app Available now.</li>
<li><strong>Lock Screen</strong> There’s three things I love about the lock screen on Android.  Using a pattern to unlock my screen as opposed to a numeric code, Having widgets on my lock screen, and specifically, DashClock which adds many notification icon types to the lock screen (much like windows phone 8) – It’s a beautifully designed app and something I’d love to see integrated right into Android</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><img src="/Blog/images/Android-Love/Lock-Screen.png" alt="Lock Screen" /></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>FREEEDOM!!!</strong> Seriously though, it’s really liberating not being told you can’t do something on your device.  If I want to use a different keyboard, I can.  If I want to use a different default Mail app, I can.  I am sick of Apple telling me to do things a certain way.  I realize for most users, that is fine, but I’m a power user darnit, let me tweak!</li>
</ul>


<h2>What I Miss</h2>

<p>There’s a few things I do, genuinely miss from iOS.  Luckily, none of them are really dealbreakers for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>iMessage</strong> Many of my friends and family (including my wife) have iPhones.  I have unlimited texting, so it’s not that big of a deal not to have iMessage, but I found it oddly more reliable than sending text messages (especially between carriers) in some cases.  I’ve mostly switched to Facebook Messenger if I’m chatting with a friend who’s on facebook (which most are).</li>
<li><strong>Fit &amp; Finish</strong> I really only added this in because I felt a bit of a traitor since my list of things I miss is so short.  There is some truth here though, there’s plenty of apps that look nasty.  Luckily, most of those apps are apps I do not use.  At this point the market is mature enough that you can pretty much find an app that looks good to do whatever you need.  I expect this to only get better!</li>
</ul>


<h2>These are a few of my favourite apps</h2>

<p>After all this talk, I thought it would be a good idea to show what Apps I use regularly.  Here’s my top 10:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock">DashClock</a> – I already mentioned it, and it’s not really an App, but a lock screen widget.  If you have Android 4.2+, you MUST get this app, and some of the addons for it</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotsandlines.carbon">Carbon for Twitter</a> – It’s relatively new, but this is the Twitter app Android has been waiting for</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana">Facebook</a> – OK, my friends are all doing it, so I need it to.  The App is quite well done (native) on Android nowadays</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly">Feedly</a> – I use Google Reader, and it was a struggle to find a decent app for it.  Feedly fills this gap for me</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podkicker">Podkicker</a> – Podcasts occupy my long commutes, so a decent podcast app is a requirement.  Doggcatcher is good too, but a bit overly complicated.  Podkicker is lean, fast, simple, and looks nice</li>
<li>Chrome, Gmail, Google Talk – I’ll lump these all together since they come by default, but they really are very well done.  I love using Chrome on my mobile!</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android">Dropbox</a> – I tend to use this one daily.  It’s very solid and well constructed for android.</li>
<li>Google Maps – It’s still better on Android than iOS!  I love the offline caching feature too, so useful as I live near Detroit and go over there a lot, but don’t want to incur the roaming data fees</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onelouder.baconreader.premium">BaconReader</a> – This is my reddit client of choice</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handmark.expressweather">1Weather</a> – a beautiful weather app.  Here’s a great example of the potential for nice looking apps on Android</li>
</ol>


<p>So, to sum it all up, I’m very happy with my Nexus 4.  Both from a hardware perspective, but I’m also really enjoying Android 4.2, it feels much more polished, useful, functional, efficient, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the new iPhone 5 has arrived, as well as the Gold Master iOS6 SDK!  Hurray!</p>

<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been under a rock, you know that the iPhone 5 has a taller screen, which means a new screen resolution to deal with for us developers!  Apple is lacking  bit in their own documentation, but a few developers have figured out how to best handle the new resolution.</p>

<p>First of all, the new resolution is <em>640x1136</em>, that&#8217;s 640 pixels wide, by 1136 high.  Now, just like the Retina display, even though this is the resolution, many parts of the iOS API report back the sizes in points rather than pixels, which means the new size in points is really <em>320x568</em>.  I&#8217;d like to share with you how you can get your MonoTouch apps up and running to be compatible with the new resolution today!</p>

<h3>First, Install the X-Code 4.5 GM iOS6 SDK from the Apple Developer site</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s listed as the iOS6 beta at the time of writing this post, but it&#8217;s really GM once you get to the download section.  You must be part of the paid Apple Developer program to be able to access this.  Download the .dmg, mount it, and drag XCode into your Applications folder.  You may want to rename the old one so you can revert to it if need be.  I renamed the old one <em>XCode 4.4.1.app</em>.</p>

<h3>Create a Default.png of the correct size</h3>

<p>The way that iOS6 determines if your app is Tall compatible or not is by looking for a specifically sized and named image file for your splash/default screen.  The name of this file is:</p>

<blockquote><p>Default-568h@2x.png</p></blockquote>

<p>This file must actually be <em>640x1136</em> pixels in size.
Add this file to your MonoTouch Application Project, and make sure the Build mode is set to Content.</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="/Blog/images/MonoTouch-iPhone5/Default-568h.png" alt="" /></p></blockquote>

<h3>Change the Simulator to iPhone (Retina 4-inch)</h3>

<p>After your MonoTouch Application starts in debug mode, you may need to change the Simulator to use the new hardware type.  Go to the Hardware -> Device menu, and select “<em>iPhone (Retina 4-inch)</em>”.  You may need to re-launch your app after doing this.</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="/Blog/images/MonoTouch-iPhone5/iPhone5-Simulator.png" alt="" /></p></blockquote>

<p>Presto, your app now runs in ‘Tall&#8217; mode!</p>

<h3>Create new sizes of other Image assets</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the image naming convention of -568h@2x.png only seems to extend to the Default image, but not other images in your application.  This means if you&#8217;re using a custom background image for your view (eg: UITableView background), you will likely need to create a new background image of the correct resolution, and determine in your application when to use each image.</p>

<p>For example, in my non-4inch compatible app, I have two images:</p>

<ol>
<li>Images/TableViewBackground.png – <em>320x358</em></li>
<li>Images/TableViewBackground@2x.png – <em>640x716</em></li>
</ol>


<p>With the new resolution, I&#8217;ll need to create a third image (I&#8217;ve decided to use the -568h@2x.png naming convention even though it isn&#8217;t observed by Apple):</p>

<ol>
<li>Images/TableViewBackground-568h@2x.png</li>
</ol>


<h3>Write some code to detect iPhone 5 and use the new Image Assets</h3>

<p>Now as I mentioned, even though I&#8217;ve named the image just like the way Apple detects the new default image, iOS6 (at least currently) doesn&#8217;t know to use it automatically, so we have to write some code to detect when the app is running on an iPhone 5, and then to use the correct image when that&#8217;s the case.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some sample code to detect whether or not we have an iPhone 5.  I&#8217;ve elected to call it ‘Tall&#8217; detection, as the iPhone 6 will likely use this tall resolution too. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jtclancey" title="@jtclancey">@Clancey</a> for some additions to the IsTall detection!</p>

<p>~~~~{.csharp}
public static bool IsTall
{
  get
  {</p>

<pre><code>return UIDevice.CurrentDevice.UserInterfaceIdiom 
         == UIUserInterfaceIdiom.Phone 
       &amp;&amp; UIScreen.MainScreen.Bounds.Height 
         * UIScreen.MainScreen.Scale &gt;= 1136;
</code></pre>

<p>  }   <br/>
}
~~~~</p>

<p>Finally, the approach I take in my applications is to use a common property for the image, and make that property getter decide on the height of the device, and which image to return:</p>

<p>~~~~{.csharp}
static UIImage tableViewBackgroundImage = null;
public static UIImage TableViewBackgroundImage
{</p>

<pre><code>get
{
    if (tableViewBackgroundImage == null)
        tableViewBackgroundImage = IsTall 
            ? UIImage.FromFile("Images/TableViewBackground-568h@2x.png")
            : UIImage.FromFile("Images/TableViewBackground.png");

    return tableViewBackgroundImage;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
~~~~</p>

<p>In this example, I keep a single static instance of my background image around, and lazy load it based on whether or not it&#8217;s a tall device.  This way the same image instance is shared for multiple viewcontrollers that use it!  In the case where it&#8217;s not a tall device, Apple still obeys the @2x.png naming convention to load retina graphics automatically, so you still don&#8217;t have to do that detection, it&#8217;s done for you.</p>

<h3>Other considerations</h3>

<p>If you have any other code that does anything with height calculations, or maybe creating a view to be a certain height, you may also need to update this code.  The general rule is you should now be calculating heights and y-coordinates based on the UIScreen.MainScreen.ApplicationFrame or UIScreen.MainScreen.Bounds.  This is probably a good practice anyway, and hopefully you don&#8217;t need to do too much work since you&#8217;ve already been following that good practice, right?</p>

<p>Hopefully that helps get your MonoTouch apps prepared for iPhone 5, before it&#8217;s even out!</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<h3>Select the right Image!</h3>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/martinbowling" title="@martinbowling">@martinbowling</a> contributed another nice method to add to your &#8216;helper&#8217; class shortly after this post was originally published.  It will help you select the right Image in code, easily!  It expects that you name your &#8216;Tall&#8217; image files with the <em>-568h@2x</em> convention.  This is another, even better technique than I&#8217;ve illustrated above.  Perhaps Xamarin will adopt this method in the future&#8230;</p>

<p>~~~~{.csharp}
private static string tallMagic = &#8220;-568h@2x&#8221;;
public static UIImage FromBundle16x9(string path)
{</p>

<pre><code>//adopt the -568h@2x naming convention
if(IsTall())
{
    var imagePath = Path.GetDirectoryName(path.ToString());
    var imageFile = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(path.ToString());
    var imageExt = Path.GetExtension(path.ToString());

    imageFile = imageFile + tallMagic + imageExt;

    return UIImage.FromFile(Path.Combine(imagePath,imageFile));
}
else 
{
    return UIImage.FromBundle(path.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
